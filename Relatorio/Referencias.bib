The results suggest that U.K. strength in standards improves the U.K. trade balance but can also act to make the U.K. market more open. The results also contradict two common views of the effects of standards: first, that standards activity in one country is canceled out by competing standards activity in another and, second, that international standards are the only ones that give trade advantage while 'idiosyncratic' national standards are largely irrelevant. The findings indicate that standards promote intraindustry trade and that 'idiosyncratic' standards can promote exports. Copyright 1996 by Royal Economic Society.},

Costs rise with the standard, and there is a fixed setup cost of producing at two standard levels. Depending on the size of the foreign market and the fixed setup cost, the domestic firm will lobby for the lowest MS that excludes the foreign firm or for no standard at all. When there is a consumption externality, the MS chosen by the domestic social planner is a non-increasing function of the size of the foreign market and is always protectionist.}

  abstract    = {The gravity model in economics was until relatively recently an intellectual orphan, unconnected to the rich family of economic theory. This review is a tale of the orphan's reunion with its heritage and the benefits that have flowed from it. Gravity has long been one of the most successful empirical models in economics. Incorporating the theoretical foundations of gravity into recent practice has led to a richer and more accurate estimation and interpretation of the spatial relations described by gravity. Recent developments are reviewed here and suggestions are made for promising future research.}

  abstract = {Although economists have long been aware of Jensen's inequality, many econometric applications have neglected an important implication of it: under heteroskedasticity, the parameters of log-linearized models estimated by OLS lead to biased estimates of the true elasticities. We explain why this problem arises and propose an appropriate estimator. Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade. We find significant differences between estimates obtained with the proposed estimator and those obtained with the traditional method.
